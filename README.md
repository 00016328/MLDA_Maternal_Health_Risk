# Maternal Health Risk Predictor
This is a coursework project from the Machine Learning module. The purpose of this coursework is to apply machine learning to predict maternal health risk levels (low, mid, high) based on physiological measurements.

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook file that contains the major analysis of the dataset. In this analysis, the trained model and scaler are pickled for the app.py file to demonstrate the prediction interface using Streamlit.

First, check the data path in Jupyter Notebook (maternal-health-risk.ipynb) to access the dataset. Furthermore, the dependencies need to be installed by applying ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’ in the terminal. In this way, Streamlit, scikit-learn, and pandas will be installed to be able to run the app in a local browser.

The app is deployed using Streamlit and is available at the following link: https://mlda-cw1-16328.streamlit.app/
